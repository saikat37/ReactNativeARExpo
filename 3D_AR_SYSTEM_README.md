## 🛠️ Switching Between Components

To change which AR system is active, edit `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`:

```typescript
// For Basic AR
import WorkingAR from '@/components/WorkingAR';

// For Real 3D AR
import Real3DAR from '@/components/Real3DAR';

// For Advanced 3D AR (current)
import Advanced3DAR from '@/components/Advanced3DAR';
```

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Adding New 3D Objects
1. Add geometry in `create3DGeometry()` function
2. Add material properties in `createAdvancedMaterial()`
3. Add to `objectTypes` array with emoji and physics properties

### Adjusting Physics
- Modify `mass` for object weight
- Adjust `bounce` for elasticity (0-1)
- Change gravity strength in animation loop

### Lighting Customization
- Toggle between 'dynamic' and 'simple' lighting
- Modify light colors and intensities
- Add more light sources for different effects

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Possible Enhancements
- [ ] Load external 3D models (.gltf/.obj files)
- [ ] Hand tracking for gesture controls
- [ ] Object recognition and tracking
- [ ] Multiplayer AR experiences
- [ ] Sound effects and haptic feedback
- [ ] 3D model marketplace integration

### Performance Tips
- Keep total objects under 20 for smooth performance
- Use physics sparingly on older devices
- Clear objects regularly to prevent memory buildup
- Test on actual devices for best results

## 📱 Device Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- Camera access permission
- OpenGL ES 2.0 support (all modern phones)
- 2GB RAM recommended
- iOS 11+ or Android 7+

### Optimal Performance
- 4GB+ RAM
- Recent processor (2019+)
- Good GPU for smooth 3D rendering

**Enjoy your real 3D AR experience!** 🎉

The system renders actual 3D models with proper depth, lighting, and physics - not just flat images overlaid on camera feed. This creates a much more immersive and realistic AR experience.
